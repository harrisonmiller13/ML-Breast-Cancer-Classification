# ML-Breast-Cancer-Classification
The goal of this project is to be able to classify a fine needle aspiration sample from a breast mass as benign or malignant.  The sample data comes from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data data set.  The samples were stained to highlight cellular nuclei and then scanned using a digital camera.  The scanned images were then run through a program called Xcyt to measure the nuclear features of the cells.

## Methods and Models to be used
I will first be using PCA to reduce the amount of features and then use the chosen principal components to run through the AutoML TPOT to find the optimal classification model to use for the data.
